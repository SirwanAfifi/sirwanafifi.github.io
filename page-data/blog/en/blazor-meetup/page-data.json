This was my first time at a meetup like this. It was about Blazor on .NET 6 presented by Steve Sanderson. I was already familiar with him from his previous work Knockout, which was/is an MVVM framework designed for the web. These days, I mostly build web applications using Node.js/React. In addition, I have been looking at Blazor. I believe that using it over React in .NET projects is a smart move because C# can be used on the client and the server. Therefore, there is no need to context switch between C# and JS/TS code all the time.</p>\n<p>During the event, Steve presented sample applications that illustrated some of Blazor's newest .NET 6 capabilities. He showed how we can build a full-stack application using Blazor in his demos. Here's some of the latest features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hot reload</li>\n<li>Smaller download size</li>\n<li>WebAssembly AOT</li>\n<li>Native dependencies</li>\n<li>Error boundaries</li>\n<li>Dynamic component rendering</li>\n<li>Render components from JS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last one was my personal favourite. Steve demonstrated how to use a Blazor component within a React application.</p>\n <img src=\"/img/blazor/ms_reading_react.jpg\" alt=\"ms_reading_react\" />"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"blazor-meetup-reading"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
