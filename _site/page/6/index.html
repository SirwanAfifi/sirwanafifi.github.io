<p>Today I was talking with a friend of mine about thinking, The topic is interesting and I wanted to share it with you because as a programmer we are always thinking and trying to find solutions. Actually it’s a good habit when you want to learn something new, instead of taking action and delve into the details, you should think about that and break it down into several pieces then construct it as a big picture. Once you get familiar to it you can start trying to figure out each individual piece, By doing so you will become great in your field.</p>

<p>On the other hand, thinking isn’t the only thing for being an expert in programming. Suppose that you are given a challenging feature to implement in a team you’re working with, you might spend days and days trying to implement this feature and each time you fail and stuck in it then you try to find a solution on the net or asking questions on Stackoverflow. I’m not saying you shouldn’t google about your problem, What I’m saying is that you should understand the problem, This is where a Thinking out of the box’s metaphor comes into play.</p>

<p>This is very helpful because when you ran into a problem you should first think about it in a new or a different prespective, For example you can put yourself in end user’s place and try to figure it out. Once you understand it, you can start coding the feature. By doing so you can help yourself and believe me it works like a charm and you don’t need to post off-topic questions every single day on Stackoverflow anymore, Instead when you run into a serious problem, you can post your question and get extra votes :)</p>

<p>So thinking out of the box helps us to think like a programmer, It also helps you to approach problems in new ways.</p>

      <a href="/archive/2016/04/17/Why-Angular/">
        Why AngularJS?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2016</span>

    <p>I wanted to share a few thoughts about AngularJS</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>AngularJS is a MV* framework for writing manageable, clean, full-featured applications in the browser with JavaScript , It’s also incredibly easy to learn for those who already have HTML and JavaScript experience. Angular’s goal was to create a way for designers to be able to do HTML design using components. One thing that I like about Angular is that, it’s an opinionated MV* framework, It means that it tells you what are the certain ways of doing things, Some people might argue that it’s somehow a limitation for a framework such as Angular because it solves fewer problems, but I think at least it assures to not having spaghetti code.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-got-into-angularjs">How I got into AngularJS</h3>
<p>I have been sitting on the fence for far too long to chose a great JavaScript framework. Finally a couple of years ago I decided to use AngularJS and it caught my attention. It actually made me cursious to learn more about it. I started to use AngularJS for some parts of my application. At the time Angular team were working on the next version of the framework So I stopped using it because I heard that the next version is a different framework. Now I have come to conclusion that it’s better to stick with Angular 1.x, then I can switch to Angular 2 in a right time.</p>

<h3 id="angularjs-benefites">AngularJS Benefites</h3>
<p>Angular has lots of great features from testability and two-way binding, to more vague concepts. For me the best thing about Angular is that it has a flat learning curve So you can get the most of it. All being said here are the some of my favorite features and benefits of Angular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code Reduction: Angular reduces the amount of code that developers write.</li>
  <li>Two Way Binding</li>
  <li>Beautiful syntax and higher level APIs</li>
</ul>

<p>For example take a look this piece of code written in raw JavaScript:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'btn'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'click'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'clicked!'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Whereas with Angular you can simple achieve same goal this way:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">button</span> <span class="nx">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"btn"</span> <span class="nx">ng</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">click</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"handleClick()"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Click</span> <span class="nx">Me</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/button</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>
<span class="nx">$scope</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">handleClick</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'clicked!'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you can see the Angular code is less complex.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Popularity</li>
  <li>Testability<br />
Angular was designed with testing in mind. So you can test any components of your application easily through both <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing">unit testing</a> and <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/e2e-testing">end to end</a> testing. For unit testing you can use a component called <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock">ngMock</a> and for e2e testing you can use <a href="https://github.com/angular/protractor">Protractor</a>. It is worthwhile to mention that for both cases you can run your tests using a tool called Karma.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="angularjs-gotchas">AngularJS gotchas</h3>
<p>Although Angular is a great framework but it has some problems that you can run into trouble with it. Here are some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SEO<br />
For dealing with this issue we can use server side rendering or use a <a href="https://prerender.io/">prerenderer</a>,</li>
  <li>Performance<br />
One thing that causes performance problem in Angular is having too many bindings. If performance is important you can consider using a different rendering engine.</li>
  <li>External Events and Digest Cycle</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Even though Angular 2 is coming, But Angular 1 is still a thing and I think Angular 1 will be supported for a long time to come.</p>

        Asynchronous Execution in JavaScript

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2016</span>

    <p>As you know browsers are typically single threaded, It means that the browser can only be doing either update the UI or executing JavaScript at any given time. It actually incapable of doing theme simultaneously.</p>

<p>As I mentioned when JavaScript is executing code, the UI is unable to respond to the user. So, our goal as a developer is to build a highly responsive UI. For doing that you could create smaller unit of work and use JavaScript timers to return execution to the next event in the queue:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">buffer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">items</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">iterFn</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">},</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Assume that we want to pull down some data from the server, Then the data is going to be processed through an array loop, And we are going to build some DOM elements:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="p">@{</span>
    <span class="nx">ViewBag</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Home Page"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">ul</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/ul</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span><span class="p">@</span><span class="nd">section</span> <span class="nx">scripts</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">script</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">ready</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kd">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'@Url.Action("Date")'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
                <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">html</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">;</span>

                <span class="nx">buffer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">item</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
                    <span class="nx">html</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="s1">'&lt;li&gt;'</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">item</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">'&lt;/li&gt;'</span><span class="p">;</span>
                <span class="p">},</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
                    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'ul'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">html</span><span class="p">);</span>
                <span class="p">});</span>
            <span class="p">});</span>
        <span class="p">});</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/script</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span><span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Also the action method is like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">JsonResult</span> <span class="nf">Date</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">Enumerable</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">50000</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nf">Json</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">JsonRequestBehavior</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AllowGet</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">buffer</code> method works like a charm but using <code class="highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> is considered to be a bad practice. So that’s where the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">Web Workers</a> come into play.</p>

<h3 id="web-workers">Web Workers</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">MDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Web Workers provide a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface. In addition, they can perform I/O using XMLHttpRequest (although the responseXML and channel attributes are always null). Once created, a worker can send messages to the JavaScript code that created it by posting messages to an event handler specified by that code (and vice versa.) This article provides a detailed introduction to using web workers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, Web Wrokers bring background threading to browsers. It is a best option if you have intense processing that needs to happen in your browser. Since Workers run in another global context so there’s a few restrictions that you have to keep in mind, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Functions_and_classes_available_to_workers">Here</a> you can see the list of functions and classes available to Web Workers. So your favorite JavaScript library may not work with workers.</p>

<p>So let’s rewrite our example with Web Workers:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">ul</span> <span class="nx">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"result"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Hello</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/ul</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span><span class="p">@</span><span class="nd">section</span> <span class="nx">scripts</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">script</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">_worker</span><span class="p">;</span>

            <span class="nx">_worker</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Worker</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'@Url.Content("~/Scripts/getData.js")'</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="nx">_worker</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"message"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">messageHander</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="nx">_worker</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">postMessage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"fetch"</span><span class="p">);</span>

            <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">messageHander</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
                <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"#result"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">html</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="p">}</span>

        <span class="p">});</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/script</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span><span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you can see I instantiated a worker, Then I setup an event listener for message, So when data comes in from the AJAX call, we will inject the result into html of a container called <code class="highlighter-rouge">result</code>. <br />
Here you see the worker:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">messageHandler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>Inside the fetch content we used typical AJAX call because in Web Workers you can not use a third-party library it means that there’s no access to non-thread safe components, So you have to use a native <code class="highlighter-rouge">XMLHttpRequest</code> in your worker. Now if you run the code you will see that now that’s pretty fast even quite a bit faster than before.</p>
