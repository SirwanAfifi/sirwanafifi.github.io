  <h1>Why AngularJS?</h1>
  <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2016</span>
  <p>I wanted to share a few thoughts about AngularJS</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>AngularJS is a MV* framework for writing manageable, clean, full-featured applications in the browser with JavaScript , It’s also incredibly easy to learn for those who already have HTML and JavaScript experience. Angular’s goal was to create a way for designers to be able to do HTML design using components. One thing that I like about Angular is that, it’s an opinionated MV* framework, It means that it tells you what are the certain ways of doing things, Some people might argue that it’s somehow a limitation for a framework such as Angular because it solves fewer problems, but I think at least it assures to not having spaghetti code.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-got-into-angularjs">How I got into AngularJS</h3>
<p>I have been sitting on the fence for far too long to chose a great JavaScript framework. Finally a couple of years ago I decided to use AngularJS and it caught my attention. It actually made me cursious to learn more about it. I started to use AngularJS for some parts of my application. At the time Angular team were working on the next version of the framework So I stopped using it because I heard that the next version is a different framework. Now I have come to conclusion that it’s better to stick with Angular 1.x, then I can switch to Angular 2 in a right time.</p>

<h3 id="angularjs-benefites">AngularJS Benefites</h3>
<p>Angular has lots of great features from testability and two-way binding, to more vague concepts. For me the best thing about Angular is that it has a flat learning curve So you can get the most of it. All being said here are the some of my favorite features and benefits of Angular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code Reduction: Angular reduces the amount of code that developers write.</li>
  <li>Two Way Binding</li>
  <li>Beautiful syntax and higher level APIs</li>
</ul>

<p>For example take a look this piece of code written in raw JavaScript:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'btn'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'click'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'clicked!'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Whereas with Angular you can simple achieve same goal this way:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">button</span> <span class="nx">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"btn"</span> <span class="nx">ng</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">click</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"handleClick()"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Click</span> <span class="nx">Me</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/button</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>
<span class="nx">$scope</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">handleClick</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'clicked!'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you can see the Angular code is less complex.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Popularity</li>
  <li>Testability<br />
Angular was designed with testing in mind. So you can test any components of your application easily through both <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing">unit testing</a> and <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/e2e-testing">end to end</a> testing. For unit testing you can use a component called <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock">ngMock</a> and for e2e testing you can use <a href="https://github.com/angular/protractor">Protractor</a>. It is worthwhile to mention that for both cases you can run your tests using a tool called Karma.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="angularjs-gotchas">AngularJS gotchas</h3>
<p>Although Angular is a great framework but it has some problems that you can run into trouble with it. Here are some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SEO<br />
For dealing with this issue we can use server side rendering or use a <a href="https://prerender.io/">prerenderer</a>,</li>
  <li>Performance<br />
One thing that causes performance problem in Angular is having too many bindings. If performance is important you can consider using a different rendering engine.</li>
  <li>External Events and Digest Cycle</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Even though Angular 2 is coming, But Angular 1 is still a thing and I think Angular 1 will be supported for a long time to come.</p>
